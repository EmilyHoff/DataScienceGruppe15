country year to defend american democracy you said happens next week crucial are concerned ever political institution evolv toward fascism key early DATEcentury european regime studi timothy snyder let answer three part the first NUM lesson i wrote i wrote DATE the book on tyranny done christmas which mean people read people read s world mean i successfully prediction history we go talk go come i want point timelineit basically blind but book describe go the year recogn fast nazi germany took year hungary took half year poland got toplevel judiciary within year it historical guess point outside limit therefore act you get early it practical advice it metaadvic past that reach quickly legally quickly it hard people act feel people act it hard people act feel like break law so important get people face psychological barrier am i worri i realiz question no i exactly worri i novemb i think people inhabit white house inhabit different world would like united state constitutional system i concern november i concern nothing happen since chang way i see thing sr let talk take place you written posttruth prefascism you talk leader fact law history how far along progression i might see go next t that tough history give whole bunch democratic become authoritarian regime sometimes fascist regime sometimes communist regime it give one storyline a b c d it give bunch cluster a bunch cluster c but really important important people realiz substructure regime change we think democracy american love use democracy characterize system but democracy mean go vote pretty meaningless russia democracy sense most authoritarian regime democraci sense nazi germany democracy sense even system fundamentally chang democracy substance rule law that people believ go count counted if believ judiciary make sense challenge if rule law people vote way want vote they ll vote safety conviction so call democracy depend rule law and call rule law depend upon trust law function NUM time automatically it function think and turn depend sense truth so you get right heart matter people truth which stuff characterize postmodern might dismiss actually really really essential the second posttruth prefascism i tri get people attention actually fascism work fascism say disregard sens disregard observation embolden proven faith faith leader take part collective myth national unity forth fascism precisely whole enlightenment aside sort myth emerg now national myth pretty unpredictable different nation different leader set fact aside actually catalyst so part lot where go the classic watch shift one governing strategy another in u system govern strategy le constituent election cycle that one pulse polit the pulse politics emergency there kind terrorist leader suspend basic constitutional right and get different rhythm rhythm one electoral cycle next one emergency next that regime take place it classic way since reichstag fire nazi nation building blame communist arsonist so term might happen next people could kind event government terrorist incident would something prepar that one lesson book sr you talk kind emergency justificationand even vladimir putin russia is think would happen because judiciary lot american institution like congress really resist they go along t they go along would emergency situation aris go along go enough paradoxically congress go along go pas bunch stuff actually popular right it go popular million people lose health insurance go happen the republican congress everything want none want popular except lobby course the freedom republican freedom agenda the mr trump the might people would like like build wall driving immigrant go slow in case wall i believ ever happen it go slow so suspicion much dramatic negative event dramatic positive event that one reason i concern reichstag fire scenario the reason prepared talk terrorism muslim ban very often leader prepar actually emerg reality sr i want topic slightly you cite many example germani NUM year hitler consolidated power so ordinary german relevant ordinary american i know fact but i talk holocaust survivor often say nobody ever thought would bad nobody thought german would go far t the german jew people understand neighbor chang understand quickly society change they understand fact predictable long time predictable tomorrow and people like think experience exceptional german jew might thought well pogrom ethnic cleansing russia nothing like could happen that many german jew thought so one issue people need realize quickly chang the second german jew aware german aware medium quickly conversation in way exactly radio time often end propaganda there internet hope would primarily enlighten but fact turn presidential tweet bot isol view enlighten it opposit a lot u blindsid internet much way people could blindsid radio NUMs but view the one german jew NUM experience that premise whole book premise DATE century show u happen wonderful german historian others happen and one first take one opportunity really history and premise book sr all book lesson personal don obey advance believ truth stand defend institution be calm yet talk systemic institutional what say people say i tri i power there cliche tilt windmill t well everyone windmill windmill would fall right party don quixote tilt wrong thing so problem we pretti problem but also alone except companion we really alone there million million people just sheer math everyone little thing make difference and much i recommend isyou right people also kind engagement whether small talk disagree whether politics and little bit engagement help realiz kind sense even order and finally lot political theory i upon come antinazis anticommunists make point even though realize example matter whole lot whether negatively there time one time small gesture absence make difference so might matter year ago matter the basic making difference whether realize basic question whether positive negative let different way except really dramatic moment time authoritarianism depend kind cycle involv popular form it really matter behav the danger say well see matter therefore go table whole question if start along start authority u which lesson one don obey advance you set table differently you say this situation i need think i go punt not wait nor see because actually becom part regime toward authoritarianism sr you cite book something i read high school eugene ionesco play fascism rhinocero people talk colleague work academia say stuff like come i agre everything give chance ionesco point people unthink know what would suggest people others fall spectrum t there one keep go another people agre and third rhinoceros stuff catch people slip like cnn last week congress one cnn commentator said oh presidential that rhinoceros moment nothing presidentialit atrocious victim commit one ethnicity that atrocious nothing presidential catch rhinoceros moment one thing i think really important think the example ionesco give people say yeah one hand jew maybe right with trump people say something like yeah tax maybe right and catch yeah favor regime change are favor end american way democracy play because really stake with people way end spectrum trumpthat different subject i think important impossible relation divid people go mind it harsh but mind one talk much harder mind at different spectrum think different way my concern right selfconfidence people deepand i think incorrectconviction something gone wildly wrong sr the people convict something gone wildly wrongthat describe trump trump opponent t that good point so much personal in book i actually anybody name except thinker i admir so much personal people think well say anything critical person like anything someone trump that way political discussion i think useful even though never win argument talk people support administration stay level constitution to stay level freedom stay level basic issue like global really go great pentagon say national security threat or really good treat muslim like or really go good million people lose health insurance keep level issue much possible i found
