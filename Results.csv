good back money metals podcast greg thanks joining us today and nice talk how greg weldon i great thanks my pleasure micheal mike gleason well back midaugust optimistic gold time we pretty good move higher shortly thereafter ended gold hitting one year high but stalled around NUM early september currently back NUM talking wednesday afternoon gold hit resistance level summer last year give us update current outlook what drivers see push gold NUM resistance level months ahead greg greg weldon yeah well exactly said you move anticipating last spoke kind already started NUMish level all fitting kind bigger picture technical structure still leads bullish resolution but accurately mentioned got close quite even towards last summer highs around NUM NUM in case around NUM ran steam the dollar kind changed picture thought process linked fed changed picture so embarked downside correction NUM low nice little correction level that level equated NUMday exponential moving average it level NUM fibonnaci retracement move NUM actually move NUM back end NUM so real critical support so everything kind mapped way might expect structurally market from one two things happens i think well one three things anyway you could cut bit low rally backed NUM you back little bit dollars still looks kind strong it interest rate differential dynamic hawkish view fed priced fed funds gets transferred twoyear fiveyear treasury notes the twoyear treasury notes record highyield relative german twoyear schatzi so lifting dollar kind gravitational pull upside and downside risk rally saw kind bwave maybe cwave towards NUM that kind ultimate low whether plays way longer term still like mike gleason precious metals pretty respectable year gold NUM year date silver half much there exactly lot excitement it seems like always two steps forward one step back sentiment physical bullion markets operate muted there multiple factors consider metals markets stuck bit rut it seems us one big ones equities market stock prices keep marching relentlessly higher either investors become totally desensitized risk maybe much risk well think in event barring sort spike inflation expectations pushes metals stocks higher see gold silver breaking unless investors start getting nervous stock market valuations thinking safe havens so thoughts equity markets relate precious metals greg and see stock prices headed near term greg weldon yeah i mean perfect question reality daily research focused fact yesterday we spoken it sounds like arranged question focusing fact gold relative s p low you really kind lows seen level get much lower breaking multiyear lows whole thing gets called question technical perspective but problem looking technical perspective i think stock market living borrowed times basically fed done exactly wanted they flushed people safe havens risk assets that whole idea qe it worked you reflated stock market that facilitated huge unprecedented rise consumer credit instead housing market collateral like NUM NUM stock market collateral googles amazons world facebooks world and demand driven really fed credit now see credit numbers start slow they unsustainable you start see consumer roll little bit so number one risk stock market actually consumer if look retail sales numbers outside automobiles gasoline pricebased much anything and eating drinking growth slowing that key component key layer discretionary spending important tell bigger picture the consumer discretionary sector breaking s p so warning sign you terms dynamics around expectation gdp growth predicated upon policies yet even agreed upon let alone voted upon let alone implemented let alone starting work so i worry kind fracture expectations patience level stock investors diminished returns diminished volumes i think stock market risk that one reasons like gold would go hand hand kind maybe statement pull back dot plot fed would cause dollar come little rally mike gleason let play devil advocate maybe little we look record stock prices wonder beyond extraordinarily high valuations past pe ratios hit levels signal markets nearing top but one big difference past today advent high frequency machinedriven trading huge amounts daily volume generated trading algorithms that game changer these programs sense risk emotional level like human traders they respond differently geopolitical events so today markets seem disconnected reality perhaps now front lines trading markets decades you witness markets transformed recent years what take high frequency algorithmic trading say possibility current equity market valuations sustained maybe even pushed higher what thoughts greg greg weldon that phenomenal question well timed given big special september called shrinkage shift fed policy but take question pertinent look experience experience decades brings back NUM right bat we saying market going crash there clearly lot differences but ask high frequency trading sounds first thing i think portfolio insurance steroids times thousand times ten thousand so risk terms catalyst causes kind cascading downside one things pointing customers way i working gigantic special shows intriguing similarities around movements dollar movements bonds movements gold movements stocks ratios even crude oil fed policy cpi now basically NUM NUM kicked plaza accord depreciated dollar a lot intriguing connections special report i writing called what me worry love make available listeners first want email but terms catalyst setting i think landmines laying wait i think take example one things like i said telling customers take amazon google stock trading NUM share you need NUM buy one share so volume trading diminished dramatically last couple years stock prices gone the ownership huge and passive managed investments matter discriminate terms type investor the people want stocks the dynamic price level high nominally speaking buy block shares amount money needed pure simple volume sets something like talking would exacerbated flash crash so becomes scary terms kind meltdown could see get ball rolling downside i still think something play time i think fed i think there lot differences i trying make direct NUM comparison but i tell risk no doubt the risk rising mike gleason in terms fed greg thinking might talks janet yellen next fed chair also tell us think going terms getting inflation want basically general thoughts fed fed monetary policy clearly everyone favorite subject greg weldon really two totally separate questions right donald trump going pick versus inflation going play i think look fed saying fed clear this jerome powell becomes seems i saying i believe i saying seems powell logical choice if goal maintain policy thinking bringing guy like john taylor taylor rule natural level fed funds would obviously much hawkish choice while trump might really gotten along maybe lot trump learn i think guy trump wants terms policy trying get growth agenda going in context maintain continuity really bad they certainly tight tightening nth degree it almost goldilocks material inflation aside powell logical choice make headline splash course loves you basically make change kind keep status quo the one would kevin warsh he away qe towards using interest rates he interesting kind dark horse yellen certainly dark horse what mattes really fed decide going deal inflation issue even decide causing because keep hearing transitory idiosyncratic these words used repeatedly describe one fed official go far even yellen made comments effect we understand materializing again kind back taylor model basic rule thumb fed counting ie hoping labor market continues tighten wages inflation go support general rise prices the question becomes natural rate unemployment lower thought or structural differences technologically based dynamics labor market hollowed labor market reason still participation rate finally little still low historically therein lies question what kind keeping inflation back play i think employment numbers month september huge sense biggest wage number know i break number to nth degree real deal only one month still real deal best wage number seen since NUM so continue we know anecdotal evidence will continue next couple months if look cpi ppi pipeline yearoveryear dynamics around commodities god forbid grains oil seeds tropical commodities started rally real problem look base models look energy potentially going break so i think inflation coming apt push fed raise meet dot plots i think going problematic equity markets they walking high wire act safety net it difficult job mike gleason getting back metals bit we would like give listeners update silver gold price rigging scandal erupted year half ago deutsche bank forced acknowledge cheating turned mountains evidence may prove damning number banks but courts regulators record moving slowly anything now much closer futures markets are aware developments front see implications civil action bullion banks do sense deutsche bank revelations led honest markets perhaps evidence struck fear banker hearts business usual bullion banks seem much influence markets greg greg weldon i sense business usual i get sense kind laissez faire attitude problem big actually kind get unearthed impact would much much larger would know based price section quickly it powder keg it blow point this something gosh i business long talking long really goes way way back the degree gotten worse i mean thing debate whether exists is going somehow uncovered extent causes kind disruption i think probably fodder great movie spy movie whatever sure probably lot kind thing going background terms day day operation trading metals i see tangible impact dealings i mike gleason well greg begin close give us sense focusing maybe things touched give us sense evaluating markets clients do think time get defensive go cash favor metals commodities inflation hedge wave exuberance stocks still ways go any final comments anything else want leave us today greg weldon well i think depends whether actually get kind job done washington republicans finally realize necks chopping block let finally ban together get tax reform package done we see whether happens i think might one last gas type moves stock market it could buy rumor sell fact i think lot priced i think still going disappointment road i watching consumer specifically the retail sales numbers really poor year it minuscule gains discretionary items since january and debt numbers interesting you starting see roll starting see rise delinquency rates the debt obligations consumers federal government way high despite fact rates still low can imagine feds actually push rates hundred basis points higher next however many NUM NUM months i think would real reverberating effect consumer government deficits still increasing high levels no one talks you NUM trillion dollars sovereign debt push fiveyear note NUM trigger increase cost funding debt man land mines i watching that clients every single day never plugged look way things happen much quickly you asked difference

share portion universal nature profundity mary responses question my question releasing shame all life i felt like i good enough i bad something wrong i currently going therapy substanceabuse problem healing i think big part healing releasing shame any guidance give would helpful mary magdalene this wonderful identified connection shame using substances you getting deep level healing occur i acknowledge awareness connection openness healing shame carry are particular arenas life feel experience shame questioner a big one i even substanceabuse problem i feel shameful like i wrong bad it substance abuse prescription medications got hand i working i feel much shame i spent last ten years life substanceabuse problem mary magdalene what medications originally prescribed questioner it attention deficit disorder i really sensitive helped kind shut feelings i could focus work sometimes i think i cut world i sensitive emotional i like i need work practical things life so prescribed but i point i want take medication i want love respect body mary magdalene so simply wanting get medication prescribed or taken medication ways prescribed questioner both i taken ways prescribed i working therapist get it past two months i able acknowledge honest so i like guidance getting also help shame i feel around there another shame started i really young this first shame i starting realize when i really young like still diapers i masturbated growing catholic household i knew shameful and i still feel much shame around i young i know i mary magdalene thank speaking when one shame even speaking difficult much fear ostracized abandoned show people part feel shame so speaking beginning healing it shows first become aware honest going areas shame then begin find people trust safe share open part that great step healing you need discernment speaking others it important open people discern safe there people may safe open people may understand hold events way it necessary even wise open people you choice people safe open people supportive open actually help ways wanting help so aware choice start empower choice rather effect random responses random individuals how part feel questioner that feels good that gives lot security guidance mary magdalene yes this beginning reclaiming personal power when shame given away part power someone entity probably trusted now stage life currently may realize entirely trustable entirely highest good they gave messages bad wrong sinful evil somehow bad wrong sinful evil deficient right good enough engaging certain behaviors this sad state affairs it thirddimensional issue thirddimensional consciousness strong belief dualities goodbad rightwrong evilgodly kinds things at higher dimensions see things differently we see kinds dualities quite destructive quite harmful people spiritual growth spiritual path part spiritual process third dimension realizing many people programmed kind thinking certain things good certain things bad certain things godly certain things ungodly kind thing those beliefs given it choice hold beliefs i would like suggest different possibility point view part transcendence third dimension moving higherdimensional consciousness that possibility see thing goodbad there thing rightwrong all experiences either supporting supporting divine growth unfoldment when young touching experiencing sexual energy forms touch selfpleasuring whatever way certainly bad wrong way point view i see completely natural thing becoming aware physical body energyincluding sexual energy connected physical body you exploring to healthy learning walk exploring physical body possibilities mobility no one said bad wrong evil exploring movement walking i certainly see bad wrong evil learning exploring sexual energy physical sexuality i see unfortunate institutions catholic church promoted belief bad wrong sinful whatever else i consider natural thing healthy thing sexuality part it evil appetite food people call hungry meal evil hunger simply energy body connected physical systems natural body the true sexuality however sexuality potential connecting god profound way way people much profound bodily functions in fact religious institutions tried convince people sexuality bad wrong whatever if belief believed understood sexuality natural healthy important vital part life connection god would naturally empowered personempowered transcend limitations third dimension thirddimensional thinking those institutions wanted people become empowered way benefited people separation power people obedience placing position power this part thirddimensional legacy it part beings learning learning transcend grow beyond experience coming earth not part spiritual path explore sexuality part spiritual path go beyond limitations thinking says sexuality shameful sinful way go beyond limited kind belief structure so point view many ways right course you experience limited taken belief systems probably natural understandable thing encountered child very likely ones trusting discern beliefs supportive take believed so took believed but adult you growing maturing spiritually this time become aware conscious choose believe choose follow ideas choose empower things seem true sense consistent experience guidance i guessing said longer ascribe beliefs sexuality even masturbation inherently wrong bad sinful yet struggling earlier programming is right questioner correct mary magdalene even kind conversation immensely helpful understanding one option amongst many many options from point view probably sensitive child your awareness energy probably high so naturally aware sexual energy young age possibly younger many people and empowering explore these wonderful things point view there certainly harm i aware come child exploring sexuality masturbating orgasms but programming individualsvery likely including family membersmay uncomfortable it may conflict beliefs level shame carried comfort around sexuality altogether programming received ascribed in fact problem probably much part told wrong maybe even tell maybe experiencing within and sensitive picked discomfort conflict beliefs and took does seem accurate questioner that exactly seems mary magdalene so first part realize really issues difficulty challenges took you simply natural sensitive self what important realize decision take issues issues choice of course young natural things like young but nevertheless choice now choice longer continue take beliefs conflicts others carrying can sense questioner yes absolutely mary magdalene again mean need go telling everyone meet feel differently different point view that may supportive you choice share but certainly relationship arenas you relative sexuality and also relative use medicine taking i shown strongly whenever makes choice always wonderful could say beautiful reasons choice those reasons i called inner divine qualities when

taking medicine questioner yes mary magdalene what comes questioner more compassion mary magdalene and perhaps regret sadness situation questioner yes sadness regret but especially talking inner

historian photo credit URL how close president donald trump following path blazed last century s tyrants could american democracy replaced totalitarian rule there s enough resemblance yale historian timothy snyder studies fascist communist regime change totalitarian rule written book warning threat offering lessons resistance survival the author on tyranny twenty lessons twentieth century talked alternet s steven rosenfeld steven rosenfeld three weeks ago said country perhaps year to defend american democracy you said happens next weeks crucial are concerned ever political culture institutions evolving toward fascism resembling key aspects early DATEcentury european regimes studied timothy snyder let answer three parts the first thing NUM lessons i wrote i wrote DATE the book on tyranny done christmas which means people read people reading s describing world means i successfully made predictions based history we going talk going come i want point timelineit basically completely blind but book describe going the year figure recognize things move fast nazi germany took year hungary took two half years poland got rid toplevel judiciary within year it rough historical guess point outside limit therefore act you get started early it practical advice it metaadvice past that things slip reach psychologically quickly legally almost quickly it hard people act feel people act it hard people act feel like break law so important get front people face psychological legal barriers am i worried i realize question no i exactly worried i november i think people inhabit white house inhabit different ideological world would like united states constitutional system i concerned november i concerned nothing happened since changed way i see things sr let talk evolution takes place you written posttruth prefascism you talk leaders ignoring facts law history how far along progression i wondering might see things going next ts that tough history give whole bunch cases democratic republics become authoritarian regimes sometimes fascist regimes sometimes communist regimes it give one storyline a b c d it gives bunch clusters a bunch clusters c but factuality really important important people realize substructure regime change we think democracy word americans love use democracy characterize system but democracy means going vote pretty meaningless russia democracy sense most authoritarian regimes democracy sense nazi germany democracy sense even system fundamentally changed democracy substance rule law that people believe votes going counted counted if believe judiciary make sense things challenge if rule law people afraid vote way want vote they ll vote safety opposed convictions so thing call democracy depends rule law and things call rule law depends upon trust law functions NUM percent time automatically it functions think and turn depends sense truth so mechanism you get right heart matter convince people truth which stuff characterize postmodern might dismiss actually really really essential the second thing posttruth prefascism i trying get people attention actually fascism works fascism says disregard evidence senses disregard observation embolden deeds proven faith god faith leaders take part collective myth organic national unity forth fascism precisely setting whole enlightenment aside selling sort myths emerged now national myths pretty unpredictable contingent different nations different leaders set facts aside actually fastest catalyst so part concerns lot where going the classic thing watch shift one governing strategy another in us system typical governing strategy less follow constituents legislation election cycle that one pulse politics the pulse politics emergency there kind terrorist attack leader tries suspend basic constitutional rights and get different rhythm rhythm one electoral cycle next one emergency next that regime changes take place it classic way since reichstag fire nazis burned nation capitol building blamed communist arsonists so terms might happen next people could look kind event government claims terrorist incident would something prepared that one lessons book sr you talked kind emergency justificationand even vladimir putin russia is think would happen because exception judiciary lot american institutions like congress really resisting they going along ts they going along intuition would emergency situation arises going along going enough paradoxically congress going along going pass bunch stuff actually popular right it going popular millions people lose health insurance going happen the ironic things republican congress ability everything wants none wants popular except big lobbies course the freedom republicans freedom impose agenda the thing goes mr trump the things might people would like like building wall driving immigrants things going difficult slow in case wall i personally believe ever happen it going slow so suspicion much easier dramatic negative event dramatic positive event that one reasons i concerned reichstag fire scenario the reason mentally prepared talk terrorism muslim ban very often leaders repeat things preparing meme actually emerges reality sr i want change topic slightly you cite many examples germany NUM year hitler consolidated power so ordinary germans miss relevant ordinary americans i know blurring facts but i talked holocaust survivors often say nobody ever thought things would bad nobody thought germans would go far ts the german jews people understand quick neighbors change understand quickly society change they understand fact life predictable long time mean predictable tomorrow and people like think experience exceptional german jews might thought well pogroms ethnic cleansing russia surely nothing like could happen that many german jews thought so one issue people need realize quickly things change the second thing german jews aware germans aware new media quickly change conversations in way exactly radio time often ended channel propaganda there parallels internet hopes would primarily enlightening but fact turns presidential tweets bots isolated habits viewing necessarily enlightening it opposite a lot us blindsided internet much way people could blindsided radio NUMs but view the one german jews NUM experience that premise whole book premise DATE century showed us happen lots wonderful scholarship german historians others breaks happen and one first things taking advantage one opportunity really learn history and premise book sr all book lessons personal don obey advance believe truth stand defend institutions be calm courageous yet change oppression talking systemic institutional what say people say i try i may power there cliche tilting windmills ts well everyone tilted windmill windmill would fall right party tragedy don quixote tilting wrong thing so problem we pretty sure problem but also alone except faithful companion we really alone there millions millions people looking thing just sheer math everyone little thing make difference and much i recommending isyou right things people also involve kind engagement whether small talk disagree whether corporeal politics and little bit engagement helps realize kind sense even immediately change order and finally lot political theory i calling upon comes antinazis anticommunists makes point even though realize example matters whole lot whether positively negatively there times one times small gestures absence make huge difference so things might mattered year ago matter the basic thing making difference whether realize basic question whether positive negative let put different way except really dramatic moments time authoritarianism depends kind cycle involving popular consent form it really matter behave the danger say well see matters therefore going table whole question if start slide along start things authorities expect us which lesson number one don obey advance you set table differently you say this situation i need think things i going punt not wait nor see things seems because change actually become part regime change toward authoritarianism sr you cite book something i read high school eugene ionesco existential play fascism rhinoceros people talk colleagues work academia saying stuff like come i agree everything give chance ionesco point people join unthinking herd know what would suggest people run others fall spectrum ts there questions one keep going another energize people agree and third thing quite rhinoceros stuff catch people slipping like cnn coverage last week speech congress one cnn commentators said oh presidential that rhinoceros moment nothing presidentialit atrocious parade victims crimes committed one ethnicity that atrocious nothing presidential catching rhinoceros moments one thing i think really important think the example ionesco gives people saying yeah one hand jews maybe right with trump people say something like yeah taxes maybe right and thing catch yeah favor regime change are favor end american way democracy fair play because really stake with people way end spectrum confident trumpthat different subject i think important maintain impossible human relations across divide people going change minds it harsh but change minds one talk much harder change minds at different points spectrum think different ways my major concern right selfconfidence energy people deepand i think incorrectconviction something gone wildly wrong sr the people conviction something gone wildly wrongthat describe trump supporters trump opponents ts that good point so much personal in book i actually mention anybody name except thinkers i admire so much personal people think well say anything critical person like anything someone likes trump that way political discussion i think useful even though never win argument talking people support administration stay level constitution to stay level freedom
