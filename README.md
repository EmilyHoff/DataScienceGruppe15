# DataScienceGruppe15

We are Group 15, this is our exam project in Data Science, hand-in 31st March 2023.

We were tasked with training a simple and advanced model on a dataset of articles, classified according to their relative reliability, 
to then use for predicting binary labels on a different data set.

The data sets used are the FakeNewsCorpus, the entire 27GB. Here we trained our models upon 100.000 rows, and validated them on 20.000 rows
from the same set. 
For our test, we used the LIAR data set, using the train.tsv file, and 10.000 rows in there.

To run this program, navigate to the directory in where main.py lies, and ensure that the relevant .csv and .tsv files are located there too

Type in (without quote marks): "python3 main.py"

Sit back, and enjoy :)
